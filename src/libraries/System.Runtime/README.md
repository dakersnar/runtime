# System.Runtime
TODO should this README be describing the System namespace (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system?view=net-7.0 Contains fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data types, events and event handlers, interfaces, attributes, and processing exceptions), or the System.Runtime namespace (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime?view=net-7.0 Contains advanced types that support diverse namespaces such as the System, Runtime, and the Security namespaces)?

TODO should we have a README for System.Private.CoreLib?
